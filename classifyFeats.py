Approaches to try out:

1.“Benchmark” with standard features, feature selection and classifier. 
    Band powers and ratios
    Filter-based feature selection
    LDA/SVM/LR
2.Unsupervised pre-training
    Autoencoder pre-training
    Fine-tuning with labeled data
3.ConvNet
    Training on raw data
4.RNN/LSTM


Important points:
- Cross-validation! Avoid overfitting
- Features -> add ratios?
-

import numpy as np
import SCIKIT!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. Setup a github and make sure I use it like I should
2. 

MAKE A TABLE/PRESENTATION WITH EVERYTHING I WANT TO FIND OUT, AND THEN FILL IN 
THE RESULTS
USE IPYTHON NOTEBOOK?
